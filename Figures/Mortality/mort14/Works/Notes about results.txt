This has worked for 

1) using cvCF as the tuning for study specific lambdas
2) No tuning — “zero” for study specific lambdas
3) Generally it appears “zero” does VERY well for specialist and a bit better for zero-out specialists
4) It seems limiting the possible etas to less than 0.9 may help (not positive).
