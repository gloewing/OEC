# Eta Plot
Shows how predictions change smoothly as a function of the parameter $\eta$ \

The data file includes a matrix to make figures. The first column indicates the value of the tuning parameter (if applicable). The second column indicates the type of data (is it a prediction on the OEC or on another method or the true outcome). The following 100 columns are weekly values (either predictions or fitted values). The first 50 are fitted values (training weeks) and the second 50 are predictions. \

The file "Plot Train and Test Fits -- Paper Example 4-22-21.R" is the file used to make the matrix above. It does not need to be run to make figures.
