# Data-Driven Simulations

Includes code to make figures for "Section 4: Data-driven simulations based on COVID-19 Mortality Application" of paper.

"simsMort2 Boxplots-NoWTuning.R" makes the figures using the output files that are in the "simsMort2" folder. It automatically reads in files and processes them to make figures.

May need to change working directories appropriately.
