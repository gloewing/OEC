# General Simulations

"sims23 Figures and Tables Final.R" has the code to make figures. The "Figure Drafts" folder has the figures produced. The "sims23" folder has the output files from the simulations needed to make figures.

The "Code" folder has R code to run the simulations (on a cluster). Necessary functions to run these simulations are in the "Functions" folder of the main repository (really only need one of them because you have to set runNum equal to the row of the "param22" file you want to set parameters to). "param22" sets the parameters (it has many rows).
